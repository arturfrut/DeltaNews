# Possible uses for NFTs

There are many possible applications for NFTs, beyond their best-known use, which is the digital representation and marketing of art:

* **Education:** university certificates/diplomas/degrees can be issued, so as not to be dependent on an institution to verify their authenticity, and to be the absolute owners of those certificates/diplomas/degrees.
* **Medicine:** Permission tokens can be issued to allow researchers to access our genetic information, ensuring that we will always be in control of that information and can decide who has permission or not to access it.
* **Real estate:** A company can buy a piece of land and issue tokens representing square meters of it, so that anyone in the world can buy 1, 2, or N number of square meters of that land.
* **Production chains:** We can have a QR code for a supermarket product that, when scanned, shows us all the information about the product in detail. We can see from its point of origin to the last step of the distribution chain through which it passed to reach that supermarket, allowing us to know the quality, origin and processes through which that product has passed.
* **Events:** Tokens can be issued to verify whether a user has attended an event, whether virtual or social.
* **Metaverses:** These are digital realities that try to replicate the world we live in, emulating through NFTs: land, properties, houses, clothes, accessories, etc.
