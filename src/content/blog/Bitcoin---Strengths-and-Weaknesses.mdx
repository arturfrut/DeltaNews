title: Bitcoin - Strengths and Weaknesses
---

Strengths of Bitcoin:
You can manage your money as you please without relying on banks or governments.
You can exchange value from person to person without intermediaries and without borders.
That this exchange is totally secure, that transactions cannot be counterfeited, duplicated or reversed after the money has already been sent to you.
It must be totally global and without borders.
It is a deflationary currency, that is to say that its price increases as its demand grows.
It is the highest yielding financial asset in history.


Weaknesses:
Very volatile in the short term, which is in principle a constraint for users, due to fear of large fluctuation.
Being a relatively new technology, the effects on the global economy of a massive adoption are unknown.
The ecosystem itself is secure, although implementation and use depend on the user, so it is important to understand the concepts in order to carry out transactions successfully. The use or management of wallets and transactions depend on the user's knowledge and an error in implementation can lead to significant losses of money.
