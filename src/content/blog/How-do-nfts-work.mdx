## How do NFTs work?

The way NFTs work is simpler than it might seem. Let’s continue with the example of a work of art: if you want to create an NFT of a drawing, for example, you tokenize it through NFT and sell that token online. In this way, you get to individualize the artwork and register it in such a way that it is unique.

Then, what is called a ‘smart contract’ is programmed. Within this contract you find all the information about the piece you have acquired, as well as everything you will need to know about the different transactions you can make with your acquisition.

As we have mentioned, NFTs rely on smart contracts and are certified through blockchain technology, just like cryptocurrencies. These “programs” within the blockchain allow users to create this type of special tokens, to represent with them whatever they want. Virtually anything can be represented digitally, and blockchain is perfect for this.

In this case, the programmer of a smart contract for an NFT token can create a program with the capabilities he wants, having enormous creative freedom. Thus, practically anything can also be stored inside an NFT token, if we have the smart contracts designed for that purpose.

For example, an insurance company can create a blockchain insurance platform, which stores in an NFT the identity and permissions needed to access a policy for its customers. Advantages? Some of the user information could be available anywhere in the world quickly, it could be verified easily, and the tracking of policy usage is done transparently.
Another good example could be digital identity, which could also be represented with an NFT: each person has a unique identity, and a digital ID protected by a cryptographic NFT would allow us to have unique, unrepeatable and secure digital identities.

## Characteristics of NFTs

### They are unique

An NFT is unique: as we mentioned before, thanks to its metadata (which you can find in its smart contract), you will see its authenticity and uniqueness, which characterizes it and distinguishes it from others. The unique plots of land that you can buy within the Decentraland game are a good example.

### They are indivisible

NFTs cannot be divided. This distinguishes them from cryptos: if we don’t have enough money to buy a full Bitcoin, we know we can buy a part of it (satoshis), proportional to our invested money. If a cryptocurrency were like an NFT, you could only buy it for full units.

### They are scarce and ‘exclusive’

They are unique, they are scarce, they are rare. Why? Because you can only define each asset once in the blockchain network, being impossible for a person to register it a second time.
