There isn't a central listing of all bonds in the USA because they are issued by various entities including the US government, corporations, municipalities, and foreign governments. However, there are major exchanges where these bonds are traded, such as the NYSE and the Nasdaq.  Here's a brief description of some of the most common types of bonds in the USA:

* Municipal Bonds:  These are bonds issued by state and local governments to finance capital projects such as roads, schools, and hospitals. Municipal bonds are generally exempt from federal income tax and may also be exempt from state and local taxes depending on the issuer and where you live.
* Corporate Bonds: These are bonds issued by corporations to raise money for a variety of purposes, such as expansion, acquisitions, or to refinance existing debt. Corporate bonds are generally riskier than Treasury bonds because they are not backed by the government. However, they can also offer higher potential returns.
* Convertible Bonds: These are a type of corporate bond that can be converted into shares of common stock at the option of the investor. Convertible bonds can offer investors the potential for capital appreciation if the stock price goes up, as well as the stability of a bond if the stock price goes down.
* High-Yield Bonds: These are also known as "junk bonds" and are bonds that are issued by companies that are considered to be credit risks. High-yield bonds offer investors the potential for higher returns, but they also come with a higher risk of default.

These are just a few of the many different types of bonds that are available to investors in the USA. When considering investing in bonds, it is important to understand your investment objectives and risk tolerance. You should also consult with a financial advisor to discuss which types of bonds may be right for you.
