How did Bitcoin originate?


The first public appearance of Bitcoin occurred on the cryptography mailing list, where a user with the pseudonym "Satoshi Nakamoto" announced, on November 1, 2008, that he had been working on a new electronic money system, summarizing its properties and the content of the original article describing his work, which was available on the Bitcoin portal: [http://www.bitcoin.org.](http://www.bitcoin.org.)


On February 11, 2009, a profile created on the P2P foundation portal, also under the name "Satoshi Nakamoto", posted a message: "Bitcoin open source implementation of P2P currency". In the text, "Satoshi" announced the official Bitcoin portal, its fundamental characteristics, the article describing the design and even the initial client with which to start participating in the network.


For the moment the identity of the creator, or creators, has not been revealed. "Satoshi Nakamoto" is the pseudonym that was used by the person, or group of people who designed and created the Bitcoin network, in order to maintain anonymity and thus protect themselves and the network. 


The only thing known about "Satoshi Nakamoto" is the data published in his profile on the P2Pfoundation portal: a man of Japanese nationality and 38 years of age (at the time of publication of this document). However, it is not possible to prove that these data are real. Moreover, given the design of Bitcoin, advanced knowledge in cryptography and mathematical algorithms can be attributed to him. 
In 2011, through an email to one of Bitcoin's developers, "Satoshi Nakamoto" completely disassociated himself from the project to devote himself to other matters.
